             <p>Waterly is more than just regular bottled water, it is a conscious choice towards a better future. The brand was founded by a group of young, environmentally-conscious individuals from Dehradun, Uttarakhand. They were raised amidst the beauty of the region's forests and the flowing waters of the Yamuna River. However, they soon realized that these natural wonders were being threatened by the presence of plastic waste and other contaminants. This inspired them to create Waterly, a packed water brand that not only quenches thirst but also makes a positive impact on the environment.</p>
            <p>Waterly's commitment to sustainability is evident in its packaging choices. Instead of using plastic bottles that harm the environment, the brand's beverages are packed in tetrapak cartons. These cartons are eco-friendly and can be easily recycled, reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. By making small yet smart choices, Waterly is helping to take care of the environment and preserve it for future generations.</p>
