             <p>The issue of plastic waste is a major concern as it is affecting our planet and its ecosystems. The production of plastic has only been in existence for a short period of 60 years, but it has increased so rapidly that it has resulted in the creation of 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic waste. The majority of this plastic waste is in the form of disposable products, such as single-use packaging, that are not biodegradable and end up littering the earth.</p>
            <p>This quantity of plastic waste is massive and overwhelming, and even scientists who have studied the amount of plastic produced, disposed of, burned, or placed in landfills were shocked by the results. The fast pace of plastic production has put a strain on the global waste management system, leading to plastic leakage into oceans and other bodies of water. This is a major problem as plastic does not decompose quickly and can take over 400 years to break down, causing long-lasting damage to the environment.</p>

            <p>Moreover, plastic waste has a significant impact on marine life, wildlife, and biodiversity. Plastic litter can be ingested by animals, causing physical harm, and potentially leading to death. Plastic waste also poses a threat to human health, as it can release toxic substances into the water and soil, affecting the food chain and potentially making its way into the human food supply.</p>
            <p>The issue of plastic waste is a pressing concern that requires immediate action. The current waste management system is not equipped to handle the massive amount of plastic waste being produced, and this is leading to plastic pollution and environmental damage. It is imperative that individuals, businesses, and governments work together to reduce plastic waste, implement effective waste management practices, and find sustainable alternatives to single-use plastics.</p>
            <p>Our company is committed to sourcing materials responsibly, with the aim of reducing our impact on the environment. A recent life cycle assessment (LCA) states that our cartons have a lower impact on the climate compared to glass, metal, and plastic packaging. This is because they are mostly made of renewable materials, which can be replenished over time and have a smaller carbon footprint than fossil fuel-based materials.</p>
            <p>To ensure responsible sourcing, we have introduced the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification system for the liquid food carton industry. This system ensures that the wood fibers used in our cartons come from responsibly managed forests, helping to protect biodiversity and natural environments</p>
            <p>Our waterly boxes are predominantly paper-based, with over 70% of the content made up of paper. The remaining 25% is a polymer and 5% is aluminium. This packaging structure keeps the beverage inside safe for a longer period of time and has a lower impact on the environment compared to alternative packaging formats. By using sustainable materials and sourcing them responsibly, we are taking steps to minimize our impact on the planet</p>
